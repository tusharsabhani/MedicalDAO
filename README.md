# MedicalDAO

MedicalDAO was created for remote hospitals/clinics to easily create a donation request for them and anyone from around the world can easily donate to them without any geographic or currency being the barrier.  
The website has 3 screens - Request, Donate & Vote(upcoming feature for doctors to vote and discuss on new methods without their country/board being a barrier)   
REQUEST -  Simple form for the hospitals to submit a donation request.   
DONATE - Donors from around the world can select from a list of hospitals to whom they want to donate.    
VOTE - Upcoming feature
